# ML-Agents Racing Car Project

## Overview
An autonomous racing car AI trained using Unity ML-Agents to navigate a race track optimally. The agent learns to complete the track quickly while avoiding boundaries through reinforcement learning.

## 🎮 Demo
[Include link to your video with timestamps]

### Key Features
- Reinforcement learning implementation for autonomous driving
- Built using Unreal Engine 5.3 Vehicle Template
- Blueprint-based implementation (No C++ required)
- Custom reward system for optimal track completion

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
